# Getting started with Vivado
**California State University, Northridge**  
**Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering**  

## Objective

After completing this assignment, students will be able to:
- Create a Vivado project sourcing HDL model(s) and targeting a specific FPGA device located on the development board
- Simulate the design using the Vivado simulator
- Synthesize and implement the design 
- Generate the bitstream

## Requirements

- Git >= 2.33
- GitHub account
- Link to GitHub classroom assignment
- Vivado 2019.1

## Tasks
:point_right: **Task 1**:  
Synthesize, Implement and generate bit stream using Vivado design flow menu bar.
Resolve any error and build issues.
Take a screenshot of the Vivado Design flow menu and number each option similar to the one shown in the class.


:point_right: **Task 2**:  
Expand RTL ANALYSIS, then expand Open Elaborated Design and click on the Schematic
Take a screenshot of schematic

:point_right: **Task 3**:  
Expand SYNTHESIS, then expand Open Synthesized Design and click on the Schematic
Take a screenshot of schematic

:point_right: **Task 4**:  
Expand IMPLEMENTATION, then expand Open Implemented Design and click on the Report Utilization.
Take a screenshot of Utilization table.

:point_right: **Task 5**:  
Expand SIMULATION, then click on Run Simulation. From the Dropdown menu click on Run Behavioral Simulation. Expand the Waveform window, adjust the time range to 90 ns.
Take a screenshot from the waveform window.

:point_right: **Task 6**:  
Push your project to Assignment repo.
